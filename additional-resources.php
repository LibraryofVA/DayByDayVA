          Abuse is not  always physical. Threats of violence, destruction of property and/or pets, name  calling, humiliating you in front of family and friends, putting you down – all  of these things are abuse. Abuse is not caused by alcohol. It is not caused by  stress. Abuse happens when one person seeks to hold power over another. At  First Step we believe that nobody should have to live with violence or the  threat of violence in their lives.</p>
