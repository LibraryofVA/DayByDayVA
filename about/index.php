        <div>The Library of Virginia is delighted to offer the Virginia  Day By Day Family Literacy Activity Calendar.   Here you and your child can embark on an adventure together through  books and reading and the many fun-filled activities that spring from  them.  This calendar will help you  identify events and activities that support early learning and ensure that your  child is ready for school and ready to read independently.  Our goal is to help provide parents with the  tools that make spending time with their children easy and fun, while also helping  young ones learn new things about our state and our world.</div>
        <br />
        <div>Here you will find ideas for stimulating your child’s mind  and imagination using materials found in your home, as well as lists of books,  music, and other educational resources that you can obtain through your local  public library.  The Library of Virginia  works closely with Virginia’s  public libraries and other state and federal partners to assist and support you  as your family navigates through the early learning years.  We hope that this calendar serves as a  springboard to provide you and the youngest members of your family with a love  of learning that will last throughout their lives.</div>
        <br />
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p><img src="http://www.lva.virginia.gov/about/images/SandyTreadwaySign.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="66" /><br />Sandra G. Treadway<br />Librarian of Virginia</p>

        <div>“Helping your child become a reader is the single most important thing that you can do to help the child to   succeed in school—and in life. The importance of reading simply can’t be   overstated. Reading helps children in all school subjects. More important, it is   the key to lifelong learning.”</div>

        <div>Librarians across Virginia   play a part in helping children be ready to learn when they enter school.    Virginia libraries provide services and programs as well as resources and access   to information that helps prepare children for school.  Yet, it is the parent or   caring adult that has the biggest influence on a child’s development.  This   website was developed to assist parents and caring adults looking for fun   activities to help children be ready to learn when they enter school, find   health and wellness information or find a fun family community   activity.</div>
        <div> </div>
        <div>The Library of Virginia is   providing the DayByDayVA Family Literacy Activity Calendar with hopes that every   child in Virginia is offered activities that assist in their development.  We   also hope that every child in Virginia has a caring adult who will help them   find delight in learning, develop a love of reading and learn skills that will   make them be successful in school and life.</div>
