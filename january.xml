		You will need scissors, assorted colors or construction paper, markers, and glue or glue stick. First, print out a photo of your child and cut out the face and a little above the hair line. You could make your child have point ears if you really want to make them look 'elfish." Cut out a hat shape, a small yellow circle (for the bell), and a brim. For the body, start with a rectangle. Use your imagination with the embellishments to add pockets, belt, etc. For the arms and legs, cut a wide strip the length of the paper. Fold the strip accordion style, then cut the strip in half to get get two long, folded strips. Cut two more strips for the legs. Glue one end on each side of the body, and the other two under the body. Cut two mittens or hands, and glue them on the ends of the arms. Cut out some elf shoes and glue them to the ends of the legs. Cut two brims and glue them to the top of the shoes. Cut out two yellow circles and glue them to the tips of the shoes. You can make an elf for the whole family. Have fun!

Create a snowman out of three large circles of paper or cardboard and tape it to a wall before class. Put about 10-15 buttons of various sizes and colors in a small bag. Have the students sit in a circle. Pass the bag around the circle and have the students try to guess what is inside. Take the buttons out of the bag and talk about all of the different sizes and colors. ("Look, this is a big, yellow button! Here's a small, black button.") Tell the students you are going to make the eyes, nose, mouth, and buttons for the snowman using these buttons. Choose one student and say, "Can you put on one eye?" The student chooses a button and, with some adhesive putty on the back, sticks the button on the snowman to make an eye. Continue with the other eye, mouth, and buttons. For the last piece, the nose, let each student try to put the nose on the snowman while wearing a blindfold!</p>

Draw three circles on top of each other, starting with a small circle at the top and getting bigger each time. Draw three buttons down the middle of the middle circle. Draw two eyes, a carrot nose and a mouth on the top circle. Add a hat. Add to stick arms and hands to either side of the middle circle. Draw a broom in one of the stick hands." When everyone has finished their drawing, they can open their eyes and compare! Award a prize to the best drawing and a booby prize to the funniest.</li>

		<em>It is good to be healthy. Jumping around and exercising can be fun! Here is a song you can sing while you jump and play!</em></p>

		We can jump, jump, jump! <br />
		We can hop, hop, hop! <br />
		We can clap, clap, clap! <br />
		We can stop, stop, stop! <br />
		We can nod our heads for &quot;Yes&quot;, <br />
		We can shake our heads for &quot;No&quot;. <br />
		We can bend our knees a little bit, <br />
		And sit....down....slow</p>

	<p class="try"><strong>Show your child the correct way to wash their hands.</strong></p>
	
	<ol class="try_list">
		<li>Wet your hands with running water.</li>
		<li>Apply liquid, bar or powder soap.</li>
		<li>Lather well.</li>
		<li>Rub your hands vigorously for at least 20 seconds. One fun way to count the time is washing hands for as long as it takes to sing the "Happy Birthday" song twice. </li>
		<li>Remember to scrub all surfaces, including the backs of your hands, wrists, between your fingers and under your fingernails.</li>
		<li>Rinse well.</li>
		<li>Dry your hands with a clean or disposable towel or air dryer.</li>

		After a Bath Song:</h3>
	<p class="sing_p">
		<em>(Make up your own actions!)</em><br />
		After my bath, I try, try, try, <br />
		To wipe myself &lsquo;till I&rsquo;m dry, dry, dry. <br />
		Hands to wipe, and fingers and toes, <br />
		And two wet legs and a shiny nose. <br />
		Just think, how much less time I&rsquo;d take <br />
		If I were a dog, and could shake, shake, shake.</p>
